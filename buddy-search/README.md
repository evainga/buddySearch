### Welcome to *BOULDER BUDDY*! 
#### This is your app to find a buddy for bouldering and climbing.

*BB* is still in a very early development stage - it currently is my playground for the WTMB JS course 2019.

To create a search you need to create an instance of a boulderer, a location and a date. Then the search looks like this:
`boulderer.searchBuddy(location, date)`

To see all searches you can use
`BuddySearchDB.load('buddySearch.json')`
